Hi there, I am the CEO of Mega Corp conglomerate Google.com and I would like you to automate a few of these end-user
actions for testing purposes. Here are the things we need you to test:

1.) Please ensure that users can use our search engine [Check]

2.) Ensure that users can look for dawn dish soap and look on the second page (for whatever reason)

3.) Ensure that users can view their payment methods (We are a capitalistic society after all)

4.) Ensure that users can close the tab on our website and still return to it without, I don't know, their computer exploding or something

5.) Finally, We want the users to be able to log out so their wives don't find their $600 purchase on a new PS5
